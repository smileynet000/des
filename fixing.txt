I took the repository down, because I'm fixing some mistakes in it that are critical. I will have it back up, when I am done. It could take about 3 months to fix. Please be patient! In the meantime, none of my other projects will compile if you try, becuase they rely on this. You can use all the prebuilt binaries, in the meantime. Thanks for understanding, I am working as quickly as possible!

Update! I'm stuck on students right now. I can't share the code yet. But if someone wishes to submit code, which can be used under LGPL, latest version, I'm open to reviewing and potentially using it. It's no longer true that you can't use ANY of my projects without the update, as I now have other projects. I'm working hard on the project, but I have some major issues with my code.
