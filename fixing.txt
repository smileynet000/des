I took the repository down, because I'm fixing some mistakes in it that are critical. I will have it back up, when I am done. It could take about 3 months to fix. Please be patient! In the meantime, none of my other projects will compile if you try, becuase they rely on this. You can use all the prebuilt binaries, in the meantime. Thanks for understanding, I am working as quickly as possible!
